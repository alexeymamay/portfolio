              <p>This reel showcases a curated selection of user interface and product animations crafted over the years. As a motion designer specializing in digital products, my approach centers on minimalistic and clean visuals that resonate with the core values of the target audience. Effective product motion design hinges on three fundamental principles: anticipation, motion flow, and rhythm. By seamlessly integrating these elements, the animations not only evoke emotions but also create a lasting impression of the product in the user's mind.</p>
